## Game Overview  
You will have 12 cards (Chose before the game starts). Each turn, you gain one attack opportunity (which can be saved for later). Use summoned minions or magic to gain an advantage.  

Each active minion on the field (not stunned) scores one point for its owner. The scores offset each other, and the first player to lead their opponent by 10 points wins the game.  

## Before the Game  
![Screenshot_20241007_214036](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c5819b8-a59d-4ed5-9383-99700cbd5b8c)  

Choose your 12 cards. Each type of minion can be included up to twice, and each spell up to three times.  

The first player selects 6 cards, then passes the selection to the next player (use the **E** key for toggling). After both players select their 12 cards, the game starts. During selection, you can only see the opponent's first six cards.  

> [!TIP]
> - Use **S** and the mouse to select cards.  
> - **A**, **D**: Navigate pages; use the **Space** key for next page.  
> - **C**: Clear the last selected card.  
> - **E**: Toggle player (press once to hide both players' decks and show the first 6 cards; press again to display the next player's deck).  
> - **T**: Toggle timer.  
> - **Y**: Decide whether to save the result chart.  
> - **R**: Start the game (press twice).

> If healing exceeds the maximum HP, the excess is converted into shields at a 2:1 ratio.

  - A unit gains this status when the Move card is used on it.
